\begin{abstract}
This report discusses about MOSFETs from their fabrication to operation to failure. This report starts with Si wafer processing. We then proceed to discuss fabrication methods for CMOS that constitute our ICs. After completion of fabrication we talk about MOSFET operation: the operating modes and current-voltage and capacitance-voltage characteristics followed by failure modes of MOSFETs and short-channel effects. Finally, we talk about NBTI and NBTI testing on pMOSFET. We discuss how the NBTI test is carried out and the tests that precede it.

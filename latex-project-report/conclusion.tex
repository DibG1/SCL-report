\chapter{Conclusion}

The lot of pMOSFET was tested successfully under NBTI test and all the devices passed the test. The variation in threshold voltage was lesser than 10 percent indicatinmg that our devices are suitable for further use. The experiment yielded acceptable and expected values of threshold voltage and leakage current.

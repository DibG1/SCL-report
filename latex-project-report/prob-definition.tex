\chapter{Problem Definition}

Negative Bias Temperature Instability is a failure mode in MOSFETs. NBTI manifests itself in the form of increase in threshold voltage and a consequent decrease of drain current and therefore transconductance of the MOSFET. NBTI is of a concern in pMOSFETs that operate under negative voltage and has been on the rise with incorporation of Nitrogen in the oxide layer and decrease in MOSFET size with every technological node. It is therefore of importance to test fabricated pMOSFETs for NBTI and understanding the test conditions and how to identify a faulty device after testing.
